## About The Project

ScribeMotion is a support group app where users can share written blogs or posts, including news, personal opinions, and experiences. Utilizing the TextBlob Python library for sentiment analysis, it provides scores (0-10) and detailed emotion lists (positive, angry, sarcastic, skeptical, fear).
The app allows other users to comment, react, and suggest improvements. Additionally, ScribeMotion can be integrated into services like scam detection, virtual health and legal consultancy, enabling the receiving party to review, filter, or sort incoming inquiries while decoding the text's subtle emotions.
